I am an M.S. student in ECE at Georgia Tech and a Research Assistant at SIAT, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am advised by Prof. Ling Liu and Prof. Min Yang. My research centers on Trustworthy AI, with a specific focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) and ensuring their safety alignment.

In parallel, I maintain active collaborations on Generative AI Security (Watermarking & Steganography) with Prof. Hanqing Guo and Prof. David Citrin, and on Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Prof. Changlai Du. My work bridges the gap between theoretical AI safety and system-level implementation, leveraging my background in binary analysis and distributed systems.

I hold dual B.Sc. degrees from Lancaster University and Beijing Jiaotong University, where I was advised by Dr. Scott Piao and Wenjuan Yu. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a software development engineer.
