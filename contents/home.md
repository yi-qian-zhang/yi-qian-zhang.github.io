I am currently a Master’s student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I also work as a research assistant at the Key Lab of Data Mining, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I am advised by Prof. Min Yang and work closely with Dr. Feng Jiang. My research centers on reasoning in large language models (LLMs), with a focus on enhancing and evaluating their reasoning capabilities. In parallel, I collaborate with Prof. Hanqing Guo on trustworthy AI and with Prof. Changlai Du on federated learning.

I hold undergraduate degrees in Computer Science from Beijing Jiaotong University and Lancaster University, where I was advised by Prof. Jidong Yuan and Dr. Scott Piao. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a backend development engineer at Huawei’s Beijing Research Institute.
